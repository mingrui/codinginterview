Rank from Stream

Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. Periodically, you wish to
be able to look up the rank of a number x (the number of values less than
or equal to x). Implement the data structures and algorithms to support
these operations. that is, implement the method Track(x) which is called
when each number is generated, and the method GetRankOfNumber(x), which
returns the number of values less than or equal to x(not including x itself)
